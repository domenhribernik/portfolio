# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website.

## Getting Started

To view the site, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No installation or build steps are required.

- The main page is `index.html`.
- The `components` folder contains reusable HTML snippets that can be included in different parts of the site.
- All styling is handled with CSS, and interactivity is provided by JavaScript files.
